## Model
<p>Fitting the model in each algorithm takes <b>4 hours</b> becasue of crappy specs of my laptop (CPU Based). It was so slow in fitting since the dataset that the model was trained has 100k+ records no GPU. ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>The model was trained on both DecisionTreeClassifier & RandomForest, each algorithm got there own accuracy score.</p>
